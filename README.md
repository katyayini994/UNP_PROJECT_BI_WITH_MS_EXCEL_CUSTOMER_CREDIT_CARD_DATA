# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA

I created an Excel dashboard using bar chart to analyze how many Female and Male members are there in the commercial associate, pensioner ,state servant, student, working.For Commercial associates, there are 750 females and 355 males.Among Pensioners, there are 604 females and 125 males.State servants include 284 females and 115 males.The Student category shows a minimal presence, with only 1 female and no males reported.The Working category has the highest numbers, with 1435 females and 913 males.Overall, the graph indicates a higher representation of females in most categories, especially among Pensioners and those who are Working. The student category has a negligible representation, and the number of males is consistently lower than females across all categories except for the absence in the student category.and it is basically an static bar chart comparing Female and male members in different categories with a user friendly layout,the dashboard enhances understanding of gender distribution.
